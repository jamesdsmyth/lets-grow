            "description": "Apples are probably the easiest tree fruit to grow and the most popular with gardeners. You may be lucky enough to have one in your garden already, but if not, they are easy to establish. There are thousands of different types of apples, but they broadly fall into two categories: dessert apples for eating, and cookers, as the name suggest, for cooking. Some are dual-purpose, so suitable for both uses.",
            "instructions": [
                "Once established, apples require very little care throughout the year. Water apples during dry spells and from when the fruit starts to swell, particularly if they are newly planted or in containers.",

The other indication of an apple being ready to pick is that there are a few lying on the ground around the tree (called windfalls). The fruit should have swelled up to a good size and started to colour up.",
                "To pick an apple, cup it in your hand, lift gently and give a slight twist. It should come off easily with the stalk intact. If it doesn’t, then it’s not ready for picking."

They are easy to grow from baby onions called sets. Although seed is available, sets are the easiest and quickest way to grow onions.
